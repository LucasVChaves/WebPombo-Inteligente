## What is it  

This project is basically a *Flappy Bird* clone boosted with Machine Learning.  
I'm trying to build a genetic neural network using the good old natural selection to teach those poor binary-birbs how to survive in their awful pipe crowded world.  

## How it's made  

Everything is done with Javascript, using the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) creative coding library on DOM, and Daniel Shiffman's [Toy-Neural-Network](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS) for those brainly brains thoughts.  

You can contribute as you will!
